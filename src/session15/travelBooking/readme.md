Travel Booking Platform

Goal:
Traveling is one of the most enriching experiences, and in a world constantly on the move, a streamlined travel booking
platform is indispensable. You are to design a simplified travel booking platform where travelers can find the best
flight deals, book their flights, and keep track of their travel details with ease. Consider incorporating features that
would enhance the user experience, such as a recommendation system that suggests the best travel destinations based on
user preferences or a notification system that alerts users of any changes in their flight status. The objective is to
create a one-stop solution that caters to all the needs of a traveler, making the travel planning process seamless and
hassle-free.
